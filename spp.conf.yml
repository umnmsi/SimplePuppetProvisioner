# You may define any arbitrary commands to be run as tasks here during node provisioning.
# The Name attribute defines how to reference the command when calling the /provision http API.
#
# The Command attribute is the command to be run on the system, relative to the working directory
# of the process. An exception is that the Command "puppet" will be converted to the value of
# PuppetExecutable, and the systemwide config file and confdir flags will be added to the arguments.
#
# Arguments are passed to the command directly (e.g. not through any shell) in the order you
# specify them here. Arguments are passed through a template processor that supports accessing
# any value passed by the client in its http POST body. These may be forwarded on to the command
# by using a template notation like {{request "nameOfPostValue"}}
#
# The optional SuccessMessage and ErrorMessage attributes are templates specifying messages added
# to the HTTP response json and sent on any configured notification channels. In addition to the
# http POST values, {{stdout}} and {{stderr}} are available.
#
# The optional Reentrant attribute indicates that it is safe to run multiple instances of the
# command simultaneously (e.g. in the servicing of different API calls received around the same time.)
# By default the service will only invoke one instance of each Command at a time.
